  This is a cool new web development project I am building while I teach myself how to code. 
  I am a student at Miami Dade College in route to Florida International University. 
  I will be transferring into their School of Computer Science in the Spring of 2017. 
  I have participated in Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science track (CS50x) on edX.org. 
  Currently, I am participating in FreeCodeCamp.com's 800hr track to their Full Stack Development Certificate. 
  My goal for the next year is to create a great looking portfolio with projects ranging from non-profits, local government, and for profit clientel.
