  This is a cool new web development project that I am building as practice while I teach myself how to code.
  I am a student at Miami Dade College (MDC) in route to Florida International University's (FIU) School of Computer Science in the Spring of 2017.
  I have participated in Harvard's CS50x on edX.org and
  FreeCodeCamp's Full Stack Development track. 
  My goal for the next year is to create a great looking portfolio with projects ranging from non-profits, local government, and for-profit clientel.
