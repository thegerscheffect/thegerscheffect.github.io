Never thought it would be so difficult to implement web designs that I see in most websites these days. On the search for just a simple and responsive CSS layout that fills the background with a high quality picture. I'm sure its just a simple copy and paste.

But right now  I'm still learning how to use git, specifically branching, forking, and recovering mistakes.
